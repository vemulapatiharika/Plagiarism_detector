## 📝 Plagiarism Checker - Project Overview

### 📌 Introduction
A Plagiarism Checker is a software tool that compares documents and identifies similarities between them. It helps detect copied content, whether it's between student assignments, research papers, or web content. This tool is widely used in academics and publishing industries to promote originality and prevent intellectual theft.

This project aims to develop a basic Plagiarism Checker using Pythonand Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and compare the similarity between multiple texts.

### 🧠 How It Works

#### Step 1: Text Preprocessing
Before comparing the documents, raw text is cleaned and normalized. This step may include:
- Lowercasing all characters
- Removing punctuation, numbers, and stopwords (like "the", "is", "a")
- Tokenizing the text (splitting into individual words or phrases)
- Stemming or Lemmatization (reducing words to their root form)

> 📍 Libraries used: `nltk`, `re`, `string`

---

#### Step 2: Vectorization
To compare text, we convert it into a numerical format using:
- TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):Measures how important a word is to a document in a collection.
  
Each document is represented as a vector, and then similarity is measured between these vectors.

> 📍 Libraries used: `sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer`

---

#### Step 3: Similarity Comparison
To determine how much one document resembles another, we use:
- Cosine Similarity– calculates the cosine of the angle between two TF-IDF vectors.
  - Value ranges from 0 (completely different) to 1 (identical).

> 📍 Libraries used: `sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity`

---

#### Step 4: Result Interpretation
The tool then shows:
- Pairwise similarity scores between every document
- Highlights if any document pair has a high similarity score (e.g., > 0.8)

You can optionally flag documents as "Plagiarized" based on a threshold.

### 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plagiarism-checker.git
cd plagiarism-checker
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Place `.txt` files in the `dataset/` folder.

4. Run the checker:
```bash
python checker.py
```

### 🔍 Sample Output

```
Similarity between doc1.txt and doc2.txt: 87.42%
Similarity between doc1.txt and doc3.txt: 34.65%
doc1.txt and doc2.txt might contain plagiarized content.
```
